# Spring Authorization Server with Wekan Integration　　
## Overview
This project is developed during my internship at Academia Sinica. It features a custom Spring Authorization Server designed to integrate with Wekan, the open-source kanban software, using OpenID Connect (OIDC) for authentication. One of the key enhancements of this server is the ability to log in using QR codes, streamlining the authentication process and saving time for users.

## Features
- OIDC Login: Implements OpenID Connect protocol to facilitate secure authentication and authorization processes.
- Wekan Integration: Seamlessly integrates with Wekan, allowing users to manage kanban boards with improved authentication methods.
- QR Code Login: Users can log in quickly by scanning a QR code with their mobile device, enhancing the user experience and access efficiency.
