## Whether to submit an issue or not?

We've very limited time to answer all the issues and respond them in a proper manner. 
So, this repo's issue list only used to report **bugs** and **new features.**

For any other questions, issues or asking for best practices use [Meteor Forums](https://forums.meteor.com/). 
Even before you ask a question on Meteor Forums, make sure you read the [Meteor Routing Guide](https://kadira.io/academy/meteor-routing-guide).

## Implementing Feature and Bug Fixes

We are welcome and greedy for PRs. So, 

* If you wanna fix a bug, simply submit it. 
* If you wanna implement feature or support with contributions, just drop a message to arunoda [at] kadira.io.
